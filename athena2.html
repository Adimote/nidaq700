  1. Xt and the Athena Widgets


    Athena Widgets

  * this course is based on the Athena widgets
  * this is the original widget set, and by current standards is quite
    primitive
  * we are using this widget set for the following reasons:
     1. Athena is widely available - it is part of the standard X
        distribution and should be available on any workstation that runs X
     2. It is fairly simple - this is about the simplest widget set, it
        is easy to learn
     3. Athena is efficient - all the widgets are quite simple and
        require a minimum amount of CPU resources


    Basic Xt Functions

  * we will start by looking at some of the standard Xt functions that
    are required by all Athena applications
  * once we have seen a few of these functions we will look at a simple
    example


      1) XtInitialize

  * this function is called at the beginning of the program, it
    initializes the toolkit, connects to the X server and does many
    other things
  * there are other ways of initializing X and the toolkit, but this is
    the easiest way
  * the declaration of XtInitialize is:

    Widget XtInitialize(shell_name, application_class, options,
	 num_options, argc, argv)
    String         shell_name;
    String         application_name;
    XrmOptionDescRec options[];
    int            num_options;
    int            *argc;
    char           *argv[];

  * we won't use the options and num_options parameters, NULL and 0
    should be used as their values
  * the value shell_name is ignored
  * application class is the name that is used for the application, we
    will see how this is used later - choose a unique name for this
  * the argc and argv parameters come from the corresponding parameters
    to main, X parses the parameters to all X programs looking for
    standard X parameters
  * on return argc contains the number of non-X parameters and argv
    contain the actual non-X parameters
  * XtInitialize returns an applicationShell widget, this becomes the
    root of the widget hierarchy of the application that you are writing


      2) XtCreateManagedWidget

  * the XtCreateManagedWidget function is used to create a new widget
    and have its parent manage the newly created widget
  * when a widget is managed the parent will assign it screen space
    within its own space, and the widget will be displayed whenever the
    parent is displayed
  * the declaration of XtCreateManagedWidget is:


        Widget XtCreateManagedWidget(name, widget_class, parent,
    	      args, num_args)
        String         name;
        WidgetClass    widget_class
        Widget         parent;
        ArgList        args;
        int            num_args;

  * the value returned by XtCreateManagedWidget is the newly created widget
  * the name parameter is a character string that will be the name of
    the newly created widget, names should be unique within an application
  * widget_class is the type of widget to be created, there are symbolic
    constants for all the widget classes in a toolkit, these names are
    used for this parameter
  * parent is the parent widget of the newly created widget, this widget
    must have been previously created
  * args is a list of resource values for the widget, when the widget is
    created resource values can be passed through this parameter, or
    NULL can be used if no resources are passed
  * num_args - the number of entries in the args array


      3) XtRealizeWidget

  * when a widget is created at the beginning of a program a window is
    not automatically assigned to it, this is for efficiency
  * first all the widgets are created, then the underlying window
    hierarchy is constructed for all the widgets in a single step, this
    is done by XtRealizeWidget
  * this procedure has the following declaration:

        void XtRealizeWidget(w)
        Widget w;

  * the parameter passed to this procedure is a widget, this widget and
    all of its descendants are realized
  * usually the parameter passed to XtRealizeWidget is the top level
    shell created by XtInitialize


      4) XtMainLoop

  * the XtMainLoop procedure is called when the initial widgets for the
    program have been realized and are ready for interaction
  * once this procedure is called, the application program has lost
    control and control is transferred to X
  * XtMainLoop waits for an event to occur and when it does it sends the
    event to the widget that should handle it, this is the interaction
    part of the program
  * the declaration of this procedure is:

        void XtMainLoop()

  * note that this procedure never returns


      5) XtAddCallback

  * callback procedures are used for communications between widgets and
    the application, whenever something important occurs in a widget
    callback procedures can be called
  * a widget usually has several callback lists, each lists corresponds
    to a particular situation, when this situation occurs all the
    procedures on the list are called
  * the XtAddCallback procedure is used to add a procedure to a callback
    list, it doesn't remove any of the existing procedures on the list
  * the declaration of this procedure is:

        void XtAddCallback(object, callback_name, callback,
    	      client_data)
        Widget              object;
        String              callback_name;
        XtCallbackProc callback;
        XtPointer           client_data

  * the first parameter is the widget the callback is being added to,
    and callback_name is the callback list that the callback will be
    added to
  * the callback parameter is the name of the callback procedure
  * the client_data parameter is a pointer to a data structure that will
    be passed to the callback procedure when it is called
  * a callback procedure is declared in the following way:


        void callback_proc(w, client_data, call_data)
        Widget              w;
        XtPointer      client_data;
        XtPointer      call_data;

  * the first parameter is the widget that the callback was called from,
    the same callback procedure could be used with more than one widget
  * the second parameter is the client data that was passed when the
    callback procedure was added to the callback list, this is from the
    call to XtAddCallback
  * since the client_data parameter is a pointer, the callback procedure
    can modify the data structure that it points to
  * the same client_data structure can be shared by several callback
    procedures, it can be used to pass information between these
    procedures, later we will see examples of how this is used
  * the third parameter is a pointer to a data structure that is
    provided by the widget, the contents of this data structure depend
    on the widget and the reason for the callback
  * for example in the case of a scrollbar, the call_data will contain
    the new position of the thumb, the callback procedure can use this
    information to move the information that is displayed in the
    corresponding display widget


    Example Program

  * the first example program puts a button on the screen, when the left
    mouse button is pressed in this button the programs exits
  * a Command widget is used for the button, the name of this widget is
    used as the label for the button
  * all Xt programs must include the &ltX11/StringDefs.h> and
    &ltX11/Intrinsic.h> include files, in addition an include file for
    each widget class used in the application must also be included
  * in this example the Command widget is used so we must also include
    &ltX11/Xaw/Command.h>
  * the main program initializes the toolkit, creates the command
    widget, adds a callback to the command widget, realizes the widget
    hierarchy and then calls XtMainLoop
  * the callback procedure simply exits from the program

  }


    Setting Resource Values

  * resources are used to specify all aspects of a widget that can be
    changed
  * the case of the command widget, the widget label, its size, its
    position, the colour and font of the text, etc can all be modified
    by setting resource values
  * there are many ways of setting resource values, we will only look at
    one of them, this technique works for most resource values, and is
    quite flexible
  * a resource consists of a name and a value, the name is represented
    by a character string, and the value is represented by some type
    that is implementation dependent
  * usually the value representation is a 32 bit word, so integers and
    floats can be stored directly in it, and for all other types of
    values a pointer must be used
  * the technique that we will use largely avoids the representation issue
  * the following structure is used to represent resources:

        typedef "something" XtArgVal;

        typedef struct {
    	 String    name;
    	 XtArgVal  value;
        } Arg, *ArgList;

  * "something" is the data structure that the implementation uses to
    represent resources
  * the name field is the name of the resource, a character string
  * the value field is the value of the resource
  * most Xt routines actually take arrays of Arg structures and not
    single resource specifications
  * the XtSetArg macro can be used to fill in the entries in this structure
  * the XtSetArg macro behaves in the following way: XtSetArg(arg, name,
    value) Arg arg; String name; XtArgVal value;
  * arg is an entry in an Arg array, name is the name of the resource,
    and value is the resource value
  * for each widget the *Quick Reference Guide* gives a list of its
    resources, the type of the resource value, and the resource's
    default value (some of these are wrong)
  * the actual string from this table can be used, for example in the
    case of the label resource the string "label" can be used as the
    resource name, spelling mistakes are not errors, the resource is
    ignored
  * a safer way to specify the resource name is to use a set of
    constants that the widget defines in its include file
  * there is a standard way to determine these constants, the letters
    XtN are added to the front of the resource name
  * for example, for the label resource the constanct XtNlabel can be
    used as the resource name
  * when we want to establish the resource values for a widget the
    following program skeleton is used:

        Arg args[10]
        int n;


        n = 0;
        XtSetArg(args[n],XtNheight,200); n++;
        XtSetArg(args[n],XtNwidth,200); n++;
        XtSetArg(args[n],XtNlabel,"my label"); n++;

  * the XtSetValues procedure can be used to add the resource values to
    the widget, the declaration of this procedure is:

        void XtSetValues(w, args, num_args)
        Widget    w;
        ArgList   args;
        int  num_args;

  * w is the widget the resources are added to, args is the list of
    resource values, and num_args is the number of entries in the list
  * for the above example, we can add the resouces using the following
    procedure call

        XtSetValues(w, args, n);


    Example Program

  * the next example program sets some of the resources in the command
    widget
  * first the size of the widget is changed to be 200 pixel high and 200
    pixels wide, this is done by setting the height and width resources
    of the widget
  * then the label of the widget is changed to "press and die", this is
    done by setting the label resource for the widget
  * now we can give the widget a reasonable name, like "command"

    Creating and Managing Widgets

  * the XtCreateManagedWidget procedure really performs two tasks, it
    creates a widget and then manages it under its parent
  * when a parent only has a few widgets this is the easiest way to
    create the children, but it can lead to inefficiency when a parent
    has a lot of children, or not all of them should be visible at the
    same time
  * when a widget is managed the parent must find some screen space for
    it, this means that the parent itself may need to grow and other
    widgets may need to move
  * if a parent has a lot of children, these operations are repeated
    each time a new widget is created using XtCreateManagedWidget, in
    this case it would be more efficient to batch all the manage
    requests and do the widget layout once
  * managing and creating widgets can be done using the following
    procedures:

        Widget XtCreateWidget(name, object_class, parent, args,
    	  num_args)
        String         name;
        WidgetClass    object_class;
        Widget         parent;
        ArgList        args;
        int            num_args;

        XtManageChild(child)
        Widget         child;

        XtManageChildren(children,num_children)
        WidgetList     children
        int            num_children

  * the XtCreateWidget procedure creates a new widget without managing it
  * the XtManageChild procedure will make the named child managed, which
    will make it visible
  * the XtManageChildren procedure takes a list of children, all the
    widgets on this list must have the same parent widget, and manages
    them, this operation saves time
  * the WidgetList type is an array of widgets
  * widgets can also be unmanaged, when this occurs the widget
    disappears from the screen, and depending upon the parent its screen
    space can be reused by other widgets
  * managing and unmanaging widgets can be used to control the widgets
    that are visible on the screen, if you don't want a command to be
    active at a particular point in time you can unmanage its widgets
  * the widget unmanaging procedure have the following declarations

        XtUnmanageChild(child)
        Widget         child;

        XtUnmanageChildren(children,num_children)
        WidgetList     children;
        int       num_children;
    		 


    Example Program

  * the next example program shows how widgets can be created and
    managed separately, and how the client data can be used in a
    callback procedure
  * this example program creates an arbitrary number of buttons in a box
    widget
  * a char array, called names, contains the names of the buttons and
    one command widget is created for each entry in the array
  * a parallel array, called values, contains an integer value for each
    entry in the names array, this value is printed each time the
    corresponding command widget is selected
  * the same callback procedure is used for all of the command widgets,
    when XtAddCallback is called the appropriate entry in the values
    array is passed as the client data, note that a pointer must be used
    for this
