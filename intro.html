      0. Introduction

      o the *X Window System* is a software system for producing
        graphical user interfaces in a networked environment
      o X is based on a client/server architecture the *server *runs on
        a workstation, it produces the graphics and collects input from
        the keyboard and mouse the *client* program can run anywhere on
        the network, it performs the actual computation
      o X is a very large system and has been evolving over the years,
        there are many details, any many ways of doing even the simplest
        things
      o learning X can take a long time if you concentrate on all of the
        details
      o we will not look at all the details of X programming, skip a lot
        of the details, concentrate on producing user interfaces without
        a lot of work


        Why Use X?

     1. Industry Standard - all Unix workstations support some version
        of X - possible to write highly portable programs in X
     2. Vast Amount of Support Software - a large amount of software has
        been written to support the development of X applications, makes
        programming somewhat easier
     3. Network Support - X works well in a distributed, networked
        environment, X programs can work with multiple workstations,
        easier to write distributed applications
     4. Customization - users can easily customize X programs, can
        change the default appearance and screen layout, etc
     5. Features - X has more features that any other window system
     6. Cost - X is free


        Software Layers

      o there are basically four software layers in an X application
     1. X Protocol - this is the actual byte stream that goes between
        the client and the server
     2. Xlib - a C library interface to the X protocol
     3. Xt or Intrinsics - a C library for constructing and using
        Widgets, a collection of Widgets is usually called a toolkit
     4. Widgets - a collection of user interface abstractions, each
        widget is a separate interaction technique
      o most X programming occurs at the widget level, though
        occasionally routines are the Xlib level are required

        Terminology

      o there are a large number of terms in X programming, we will
        start by defining some of the important ones, some of them we
        will come back to later to fill in the details


          1) Window

      o the basic unit in an X program, and abstraction of a terminal a
        window provides a place to draw graphics and collects input from
        devices
      o the important properties of windows are:
         1. *parent* all windows have a parent window, the windows in an
            application form a tree, a window must lie within the
            coordinate space of its parent
         2. *window ID* an integer that identifies the window, this is a
            server resource, several processes can refer to the same
            window using its ID
         3. *position* the location of the upper left corner of the
            window within its parent's coordinate system
         4. *width, height* and *border width*, the width is the size of
            the window in the x direction, the height is the size of the
            window in the y direction, and the border width is the width
            of its border, all measured in pixels
         5. *coordination system* each window has its own coordinate
            system. The origin is in the upper left corner, x increases
            to the right, y increases towards the bottom, coordinates
            are integers and correspond to pixels
         6. *attributes*, there are many of these, including background
            colour, border colour, cursor, colourmap, etc

          2) Widget

      o a widget is a user interface abstraction, it implements some
        part of a user interface, for example menu, scrollbar, button,
        text entry, etc
      o each widget has a window where it displays its information, it
        also reacts to user actions, such as the mouse and keyboard
      o a widget is like an abstract data type, or an object in an
        object-oriented system
      o most X programming deals with widgets


          3) Resources

      o a resource is a named piece of data, usually part of a widget
      o the user or application can set the value of a widget, the
        application can also retrieve resource values
      o resources are mainly used to control widgets, all the important
        properties of a widget are resources


          4) Callbacks

      o a callback is an application procedure, has a particular format
      o a callback is called when something happens in a widget, for
        example, when a button is pressed, or a scrollbar is moved
      o this is the main communications mechanism between widgets and
        the application
      o X has control of the application, all application computing
        occurs through callbacks


          5) Translations

      o translations specify how user events (button presses) are processed
      o for each widget you can specify what a button press "means", the
        procedure that will be executed when the action occurs
      o this gives the user more control over the application


          6) Widget Classes

      o all widgets belong to a widget class, all the widgets in a class
        have the same basic appearance and behave in the same way
      o like objects and classes in object-oriented programming
      o the class defines the widget, when a widget is created the
        widget class is used to specify the type of widget to be created
      o widget classes are organized into a hierarchy, each widget,
        except for the root (core widget) has a parent
      o a widget class inherits from its parent, it can inherit
        resources, appearance and behavior
      o in order to determine what a widget does you must know where its
        widget class fits into the widget class hierarchy


          7) Widget Hierarchy

      o the widget instances also form a hierarchy
      o when a widget is created its parent instance must be specified,
        the widget instance is placed within its parent
      o the parent widget controls where the child widget is placed on
        the screen, and when it appears on the screen
      o the widget hierarchy is used in resource naming
      o the widget hierarchy is an important part of the user
        documentation for a X program, the user needs this information
        to customize the widgets


          8) Widget Sets or Toolkits

      o widgets classes are collected into widget sets or toolkits, a
        set of widgets that work together, provide the basic
        functionality required to construct user interfaces
      o there are many widget sets, differ in appearance and some
        behavior, all have the same basic functionality
      o once you know one set, learning other is quite easy
